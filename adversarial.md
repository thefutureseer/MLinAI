# Adversarial ML  
refers to a subfield of machine learning where an adversary attempts to deceive or mislead a model by introducing malicious or carefully crafted input data, with the goal of causing the model to make incorrect predictions or classifications. This type of attack can be used to undermine the security or integrity of machine learning systems in various domains such as cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection. Adversarial ML involves developing models that are robust to such attacks, detecting and mitigating them in real-time, and exploring the theoretical foundations and practical implications of such attacks on machine learning systems.
